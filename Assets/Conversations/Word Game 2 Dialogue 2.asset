  sentences:
  - The four faces of Davina Cage laugh in unison and speak their legendary greeting...
  - '"MERRY CHRISTMAS!" the four voices echo together across the Veldt.'
  - 'Then they take turns to speak.

    Face One says: "We have arrived as it was
    ordained. What you did to Purple-chan was foretold in our Indigo Prophecy. We
    will switch things up."'
  - "Face Two says: \"You've done okay but it's still just a tad boring here\u2026
    I think I will bring a Heavy Rain!\u2026 \u2026of meteorites!"
  - 'Face Three says: "We were not always Four, or Three, or Two. I mark the moment
    we went Beyond: Two Souls. I will right some of the wrongs in this mess."'
  - "Face Four says: \u2026 nothing? It just laughs at the disorder on the Veldt.
    Perhaps the most Human reaction but it still disturbs you."
  - The other faces begin to laugh too.
