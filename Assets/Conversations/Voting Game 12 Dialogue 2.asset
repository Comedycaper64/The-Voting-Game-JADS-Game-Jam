  sentences:
  - The sky darkens.
  - Davina Cage begins to laugh. Her faces bulge. Her arms stretch away from her
    body.
  - Then the laughter turns into screaming.
  - Something erupts from her chest. Then, in one instant, her entire body is obliterated.
    A rain of blood and bullshit spews over the Veldt.
  - Votos floats in the place that Davina Cage once occupied. Somehow clean. Pristine.
    Her eyes sweep the Veldt.
  - Everyone could vote? A lesser Dragon Angel in Outer Heaven? A BOMB DEFUSED? Ace
    Combat 7 somehow won? METEORITE DOWNVOTE BUTTONS?!
  - This cannot be.
