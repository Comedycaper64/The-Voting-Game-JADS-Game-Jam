  sentences:
  - '"M-Mommy Votos would never allow it," Purple-chan finally speaks. She pushes
    you away from hugging her.'
  - Over the range and far away, you hear a crackle of energy coming from Votos.
    Then it passes.
  - "\"Never have I\u2026\" Purple-chan stops herself. She hops away once. Twice.
    She mutters."
  - Other than that the Veldt is strangely silent. There's a hole where Umineko used
    to be.
  - '"Can''t you see this is what I wanted?" Purple-chan shouts as she suddenly turns
    to you, hopping madly.'
  - '"Only you could have f-freed me from this torment!'
  - I thought I could trust you. I-I'm doomed now!
  - "N-Never have I doubted what I am. I know I'm a Dummy. But t-this\u2026 is the
    first t-time I've felt like one.\""
