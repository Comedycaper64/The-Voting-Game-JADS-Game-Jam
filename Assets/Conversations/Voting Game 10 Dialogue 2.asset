  sentences:
  - And it did come...
  - Many brave games were felled.
  - Fire Emblem, Xenoblade 1, and Yakuza Kiwami among them.
  - But despite that, others got to live.
  - The selfless dragon angel claims her place within the Halls of Ascension...
  - ...and her powers propel the defused bomb into Outer Heaven, giving her the rest
    she deserves.
  - Kawaiinamite, now a cute abomination of flesh and steel, barely survives the
    impact from Votos. Kawaiinamite then does her duty and explodes, sending a shockwave
    both above and below from her position.
  - These do not stop until they found a weeb game on the Veldt and, since the Veldt
    is a donut, the power sent upward finds the first weeb game on the bottom of
    the list. Whereas the blast sent below finds a target quickly.
  - 'Sakuya Izayoi Gives You Advice And Dabs: Nitori Kawashiro Offers You Advice
    In Exchange For Cucumbers And Eats The Cucumbers is culled

    , as is Dark
    Chronicle.'
  - Votos leaves the Veldt without a word. The training dummies dissolve, leaving
    only their cross-like support stands where they once stood as a remnant. The
    pieces of Kawaiinamite remain, however.
  - All is quiet for a time. The sky remains dark.
  - 'An hour passes. A shaft of light breaks the clouds and illuminates the broken
    chunks of Kawaiinamite. As if the explosion is happening in reverse, her body
    reassembles itself and then explodes again. '
  - She screams and is then gone. Only a single shard of her is left behind. Imperceptible,
    unless you knew where to look.
  - A glowing light enters Outer Heaven. Just as the Dragon Angel is about to leave,
    having done her strange duty that she does not fully understand any longer.
  - "The glowing light does not allow her to leave\u2026"
