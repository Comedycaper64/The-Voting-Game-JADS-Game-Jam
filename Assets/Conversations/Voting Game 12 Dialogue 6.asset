  sentences:
  - Votos has become Vakotos, The Archangel of Injustice.
  - A pillar of light descends from the heaven in the middle of the Veldt. Another
    matches it, ascending from hell. They join together in the middle of the donut
    hole.
  - Vakotos will destroy the game now. Double Hell, The Culled Games, The Veldt,
    The Halls, and Outer Heaven.
  - And there's nothing you can do about it.
  - GAME OVER
  - 
  - ...
  - A Glowing Light
  - The glowing ball of light in Outer Heaven pulsates as it receives voting power.
  - "Votos\u2026 or what she once was\u2026 returning to the game has stirred something
    inside of it."
  - Whatever speck of power that was imbued from Votos that ascended to Outer Heaven
    for what the Voting Universe saw as an Act of Justice.
  - And that power unleashes tendrils from the glowing ball that consume the Dragon
    Angel next to it.
  - Bomb-chan shields her eyes as waves of light blast through Outer Heaven. Still
    she is blinded, and so disorientated, that she doesn't realize she is being pulled
    into it too.
  - She is a hair's breadth from being sucked into the glowing cascade when it ceases.
    Violently. Bomb-chan is thrown back.
  - When she stands up, a single wing now protrudes from her left shoulder blade.
  - Purple-chan is standing where the ball of light had been. A matching wing extending
    from her right shoulder.
  - The sky darkens.
  - ...
  - Vakotos is in a trance. The Veldt is already beginning to break apart.
  - The shard of kawaiinamite begins to glow. A sliver of light snakes upward toward
    the heavens, longing to be reunited with the rest of its body.
  - When the tip pierces the clouds it begins to expand. It forms a hilt in Outer
    Heaven. One that Purple-chan is waiting to grab.
  - A sword of light and energy stretches from her hand down to the Veldt. She grips
    it tightly.
  - ...
