  sentences:
  - The two chans grip the sword.
  - They lift.
  - ...
  - Parts of the Veldt are crumbling into the pillar in the donut hole now. Vakotos
    is aware of nothing else.
  - Is she even alive anymore? Even sentient? Or an instrument of twisted justice.
  - She neither sees nor feels her body cleaves in two from the blade that stretches
    between planes.
  - Blood seeps from her from only a moment before her form disintegrates into light.
    Then that fades too. Into nothing.
  - The explosion that follows appears impossible. What was left to cause it? But
    it happens all the same.
  - The Veldt is burning. Permanently scarred. Pillars topple in the Halls of Ascension.
    No one in hell still seems to care. But the universe remains intact.
  - ...
  - Bomb-chan and Purple-chan sit next to each other, admiring the fires below in
    a mix of pride of horror.
