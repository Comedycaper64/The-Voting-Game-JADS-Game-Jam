  sentences:
  - The two chans grip the sword.
  - Parts of the Veldt are crumbling into the pillar in the donut hole now. Vakotos
    is aware of nothing else.
  - She neither sees nor feels her body cleaves in two from the blade that stretches
    between planes.
  - The explosion that follows appears impossible. What was left to cause it? But
    it happens all the same.
  - ...
  - Bomb-chan and Purple-chan sit next to each other, admiring the fires below in
    a mix of pride of horror.
